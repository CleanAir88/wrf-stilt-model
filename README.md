 First, create a data directory on the server to store meteorological files and computation resultsÔºö
 mkdir ÔºàpwdÔºâ/data

 docker run -d --name wrf-stilt-model -p 8000:8000 -p 5555:5555 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/src/data \
  gfs-stilt-model 

```

## STILT Executable Registration

In order to run STILT with forecast meteorology, you must obtain the official HYSPLIT binary.

Apply for access here:
